# 🚘 Complete Self-Driving Car Simulation Project

A **Self-Driving Car**, also called an autonomous vehicle, is a car that uses sensors, AI models, and deep learning to drive itself without human input. This project demonstrates a simulation of such a car by integrating signal detection, lane tracking, and real-time control, all inside a virtual environment powered by **Udacity’s Self-Driving Car Simulator**.




## 🧠 Key Features

- 🚦 Signal Detection using CNN and Traffic Sign Dataset
- 🛣️ Lane Detection using Deep Learning (MapNet)
- 📸 Input from virtual sensors (via Unreal Engine)
- 🕹️ Live GUI interface for simulation control
- 📊 Real-time accuracy evaluation
